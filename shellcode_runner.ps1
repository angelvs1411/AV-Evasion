# This script executes shellcode in memory with PS with help from C# and .NET.
# We will look up the C# signature calls for VirtualAlloc and CreateThread and
# add them to our class. 
# We can use the .NET Copy method from System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal
# Be sure to execute this script with the 32-bit powershell if executing in a 
# 32-bit application such as Office 2016.
